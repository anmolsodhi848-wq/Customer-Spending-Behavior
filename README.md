# Process

1. **Data Extraction & Cleaning:** Imported the raw sales dataset from MS Excel, removed duplicates, standardized date formats, corrected missing values, and ensured consistency across fields such as product categories, regions, and payment methods.
2. **Feature Engineering & Transformation:** Derived analytical fields such as Total Sales, Profit, Gross Margin, Discount Applied, Shipping Expense, and Average Order Value. Categorized data by month, quarter, region, and customer segments for deeper insights.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed trend analysis across sales, customer segments, product categories, and regions. Identified patterns in profit contribution, discount impact, sales channel efficiency, and seasonal variations.
4. **Dashboard Development & KPI Mapping:** Designed interactive dashboards to visualize KPIs, sales trends, regional performance, product ratings, and customer behavior. Mapped KPIs to business outcomes for quick decision-making.
